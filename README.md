# mc-serverrunner
made this little python script to run the bat/ files of minecraft serverpacks after accumulating them into a list, it basically just takes a folder full of .lnks or .sh and lets you run them in a terminal enviorment the same way as opening them in the actual file explorer!!!
I probably will never itterate on this because I no longer do hosting and if I did I'd use something better?
